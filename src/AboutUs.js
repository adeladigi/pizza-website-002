           <p>WelcomeIn  1985,  Chef  Ernesto  opened  Adela's Pizza and   Family   Restaurant.
              Today,   under   the care  of  jim  &  kat,  k&V  continues  to  be part     of 
              the     community,     with     many customers  having  been  raised  on  our  food.
              k&V   is   a   great   place   for   a   quick   bite   or dinner   with   the   whole
              family.   Order   for pickup     or     delivery,     eat     in     our     cozy restaurant,
              or   celebrate   special   occasions with   a   private   party.   At   k&V,   there   is   a
              commitment  to  using  quality  ingredients and    serving    fresh    food,    with    generous
              portions.   The   staff   at   k&V   goes   the   extra mile   to   ensure   the   best   service
              possible, and  you  are  treated  like  a  friend.  k&V  is  a small,  old  school  neighborhood
              place.  The restaurant  is  designed  to  make  you  feel  like you  are  sitting  and  relaxing
              in  a  outdoor Italian courtyard.</p>
